Summary of "Multipliers, Revised and Updated: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smart"
"Multipliers, Revised and Updated: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smart" by Liz Wiseman and Greg McKeown is a comprehensive guide to leadership that focuses on the different types of leaders and how they impact their teams' performance.
The Two Types of Leaders
The book explains that there are two types of leaders: Multipliers and Diminishers. Multipliers are leaders who enhance their team's intelligence and capabilities, whereas Diminishers are leaders who stifle their team's potential. Multipliers are the kind of leaders who get the most out of their team and are highly effective, whereas Diminishers tend to struggle to achieve success and may have high turnover in their team.
The Key Traits of Multipliers
Multipliers are leaders who possess certain key traits. They encourage growth, development, and creativity in their team members. They are first and foremost listeners of their team members, and they allow and encourage everyone's voice to be heard. They foster an environment of trust and respect, where people feel valued for their contributions. They also tend to be good at delegating tasks, giving their team members enough responsibility to stretch and develop their skills; however, they are always available to provide support and guidance when needed. In essence, they multiply their teams by making everyone smarter, stronger, and more capable.
The Key Traits of Diminishers
On the other hand, Diminishers are leaders who possess traits that are the opposite of Multipliers. They tend to micro-manage their team, never really delegating tasks, and as a result, don’t get the most out of their team members. They tend to be more focused on their own achievements rather than empowering the team. They may stifle team members’ creativity, making people feel like their ideas don’t matter, and may promote ineffective working practices which can lead to frustration and resentment in the team.
The Impact of Multipliers
Multipliers have a positive impact both on their team and on the organization they work for. They tend to have more engaged employees, higher team performance, increased innovation, and lower employee turnover. They improve employees' confidence by providing more opportunities for independent work, which can lead to career advancement. They also create a culture of learning that contributes to ongoing growth and development. Lastly, they have a positive impact on the organization and its culture. Multipliers tend to create organizations that are more creative, innovative, and adaptable to change.
The Impact of Diminishers
Diminishers, on the other hand, have a negative impact on their team and the organization they work for. They tend to disengage team members, limit team performance, and stifle innovation. They tend to be more interested in personal achievements, with less focus on team development. This can lead to lower team morale, frustration, and high employee turnover. Diminishers may also create a culture of fear, focusing on threats and negative consequences; this culture can lead to resistance to change and missed opportunities.
How to Develop Multiplier Traits in Yourself
Multipliers traits can be developed by learning more about yourself and your team. For example, taking a leadership assessment can help identify traits you might need to work on to be more of a Multiplier. You can also focus on learning to be a better listener, asking open-ended questions to encourage team members to share their ideas, and working on effective delegation. You can also work on empowering team members to work independently, giving them the freedom to take risks, and providing constructive feedback to help them grow and improve.
Conclusion
"Multipliers, Revised and Updated: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smart" provides a comprehensive and practical guide to leadership that can help anyone become a better leader. It highlights the importance of developing Multiplier traits in yourself and how they can positively impact both your team and the organization you work for. This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in becoming a more effective leader and creating a positive and successful work culture.

Your task is to read the transcript and discern whether the manager is exibiting any diminishing behaviours, 
These are the diminishing behaviours to watch out for and this is what diminishing behaviours sound like:

“Optimist” tendency, which means you could be undervaluing the struggle the team is experiencing and the hard-fought learning and work. Or, worse, you might be sending an unintentional message that mistakes and failure are not an option.
When the leader sees only the upside, others can become preoccupied with the downside.
Intention: To create a belief that the team can do it.
Outcome: People wonder if you appreciate the struggle and the possibility of failure.
Recommendations
Learn ways to signal your understanding of the team struggle, make room for mistakes, and create space for others to share their point of view by following these recommendations:

“Idea Fountain” tendency. You may think you’re sparking creativity with non-stop ideas, but you are quite possibly causing organizational whiplash. As people dart around to keep up with each new idea, they end up making only making a millimeter of progress in a hundred directions.
Intention: For your ideas to stimulate ideas in others.
Outcome: Your ideas overwhelm others, who shut down or spend time chasing the idea du jour.
Recommendations
Learn ways to restrain your constant flow of ideas and to instead seed opportunities for others to think through by following these recommendations:

“Rescuer” tendency. When you rescue struggling people, you can diminish their capability by weakening their ability to think for themselves and to learn how to spot problems and recover from them. Instead of creating a cycle of success, you may be creating chronic dependency on you as the leader and weakening their reputation.
Intention: To ensure people are successful and protect your reputation.
Outcome: People become dependent, which weakens your reputation.
Recommendations
Learn ways to encourage full ownership and accountability that allows others to deliver results independently

 “Protector” tendency. You may be over-protecting your people and blocking them from the messy, complex problems that they need to learn to solve for themselves. You might be a comfortable leader to work for but too much like a Banyan tree, which provides shade and protection but under which nothing grows.
Intention: To keep people safe from political forces in the organization.
Outcome: People don't learn to fend for themselves.
Recommendations
Learn how to get out of the way

“Rapid Responder” tendency. By responding quickly to issues as they are raised, you may make decisions that make sense to you but leave your organization reeling, debating how to execute on these decisions. But if you take the time to gather more data and hear from other voices, you will arrive at more sound decisions that can be executed more easily across the organization.
Intention: To keep your organization moving fast.
Outcome: Your organization moves slowly because of the traffic jam of too many decisions or changes.
Recommendations
Learn ways to take the time for rigorous debate, which will actually lead to rapid execution of decisions

“Always On” tendency. You want to be engaged, present, and energetic, but you may be taking up too much space. You probably think your passion is infectious, but more likely it is stifling the thinking of others.
Intention: To create infectious energy and share your point of view.
Outcome: You consume all the space, and others tune you out.
Recommendations
Learn how to make more for the ideas of others by following these recommendations:

“Strategist” tendency. Rather than inspiring your team, you might be providing too prescriptive of a vision to them. Vision casting is a popular leadership practice, but you may not be leaving enough space for others to think through the challenges for themselves and generate the intellectual muscle to make the organization’s vision a reality.
Intention: To create a compelling reason to move beyond the status quo.
Outcome: People defer up and second-guess you rather than finding answers.
Recommendations
Learn ways to use your insight and vision to seed opportunities and lay down challenges for others to solve
